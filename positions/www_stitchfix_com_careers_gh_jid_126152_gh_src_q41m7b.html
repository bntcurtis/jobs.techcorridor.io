  <p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Stitch Fix is an online personal styling startup in San Francisco, combining art and science to disrupt and redefine the retail industry. Our engineering teams build the tools that run our business, from our customer-facing website and mobile app to unique and innovative tools that power our warehouse, merchandising, and styling teams. </span><span style="font-weight: 400;">We leverage vast amounts of client data to make decisions throughout the company. All of this results in a simple, powerful offering to our customers and a successful, growing business. We believe we are only scratching the surface of our opportunity, and we’re looking for incredible people to contribute!</span></p>
<h3><strong>About Engineering </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our team is made up of key engineers who built and scaled organizations like Google, Netflix, eBay, and LivingSocial. We build modern software with modern techniques like TDD, continuous delivery, DevOps, and service-oriented architecture. Cross functional partnership is deeply meaningful to us, and is how we’ve built up immense trust with the people running the business. &nbsp;We focus on high-value products that solve clearly identified problems, and design them in a sustainable way. &nbsp;In fact, some of our proudest moments come from solving business problems without writing a line of code.</span></p>
<h3><strong>About the Role </strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Product is a big aspect of what we do.</span> <span style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;As a Principal Engineer you will define the product roadmap and technical architecture for your team. Your drive to dig into complex technology and apply solutions to the business in clean, elegant, innovative ways makes you the trusted advisor to director-level business partners to understand needs and balance competing priorities. </span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">You won’t do this alone. &nbsp;Working &nbsp;with a team of engineers, you’ll help decide what to build and how to build it. &nbsp;You’ll not only utilize our current architecture and tools to help the team ship quality software quickly but you will also identify where we need to grow our architecture and technical expertise. &nbsp;You’ll help the team to understand the work in front of them, see the most valuable opportunities, and help drive them to the best results. You’ll help engineers and business partners turn big problems into a series of small, shippable solutions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>About the Teams </strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Currently, we are looking for Principal Engineers for several of our teams:</span></p>
<h3><strong>About Warehouse, Inventory, and Operations Engineering Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our warehouse, inventory, and operations team cannot succeed without strong engineers. &nbsp;As a Principal Engineer, you’ll work with our business partners to create a roadmap for delivering solutions to warehouse process improvement, workforce management, logistics decision-making, and workflow optimization. &nbsp;You’ll also be on the front-lines building and delivering them. &nbsp;We have a system that scales linearly with our business, and we need your help to make it logarithmic.</span></p>
<h3><strong>About Merchandising Engineering Team</strong></h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our Merchandising Tools team builds products to help the Women’s and Men’s merchandising departments. As a Principal Engineer, you will build tools that cover planning, buying, allocation and new style development. You will also work closely with the data science team dedicated to merchandising, helping to turn their powerful data-driven recommendations into seamless elements of the merchants’ workflows. Our aim is to help Stitch Fix merchants be the most innovative and efficient in the retail world.</span></p>
<h3><strong>About Styling Platform Engineering Team</strong></h3>
<h3><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Styling engineering team builds the web platform that our stylists use to style our clients. As a Principal Engineer, you will build tools that allow our stylists to efficiently choose the perfect items to send to each of our clients. You'll also work closely with our data science team to incorporate recommendation algorithms and run experiments to test possible new ideas and improvements. The styling platform is in many ways the heart of the business, and crucial to our success.</span></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
