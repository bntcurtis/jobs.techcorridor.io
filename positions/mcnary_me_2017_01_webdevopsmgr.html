<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">McNary Marketing </span><b>helps businesses</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> discover &amp; implement the best marketing &amp; sales technology, so they can sell more while doing less. We allow each business to utilize the best technology for their situation, work, and mission.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><b>Our team is small but growing</b><span style="font-weight: 400;">. We have a few core employees, led by our founder — Joshua McNary. This is complemented with around a dozen certified-trusted contractors.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">We have had </span><b>continued growth</b><span style="font-weight: 400;"> over the last three years of the company’s existence and aim to speed this growth going forward. </span></li>
